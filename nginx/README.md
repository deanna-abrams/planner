SSL NOTES

• Our real SSL certificate is provided by Cloudflare when we proxy traffic through.  

• Secure information is not currently transmitted to this server.  It is in it's current form purely a static site.

• As a best practice, real SSL keys and certificates should never be checked into a source repository.  The dummy SSL key and certificate exist purely to prevent nginx from complaining.
